Yun.Liu, Gangyi.Jiang, Mei.Yu,et al,MEFLFD dataset. Available: https://github.com/yaokeke/MEFLFD-dataset


The MEFLFD contains 30 real scenes, and each scene was captured by the Lytro Illum light field camera to generate three source LFIs, i.e., under-exposure LFI, normal-exposure LFI and over-exposure LFI. the spatial resolution is 434×625 and the angular resolution is 9×9. Besides, Six non-linear MEF algorithms and four linear MEF algorithms, and the commercial HDR software Photomatix were used to create the MEF-LFIs. For the MEF-LFIs generated by the MEF algorithms in the linear domain and HDR software Photomatix,tone mapping operator is selected for visualization on SDR display devices. Therefore, there were total of 480 MEF-LFIs in the MEFLFD.
